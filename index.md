I'm a biomedical engineer with a particular interest in imaging and instrumentation. I recently graduated from the University of Waterloo with a B.ASc in Systems Design Engineering. I'm looking for a full time role working with friendly people and interesting technology.


Most recently, I worked for [Dr. Chris Macgowan](http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Directory/People/M/christopher-macgowan-staff-profile.html) as a medical imaging engineer at the Hospital for Sick Children. Previously, I worked and as a researcher in Professor [Edith Law's lab](http://edithlaw.ca/) on the [CrowdEEG project](http://crowdeeg.ca/). 


For my full work history, please see my [resume](pdfs/Josh_Bradshaw_CV.pdf). My [projects page](projects) showcases my academic and personal projects. The best way to reach me is by [email](mailto:#joshbradshaw11@gmail.com). I'm also on [Linkedin](https://github.com/JoshBradshaw) and [Github](https://github.com/JoshBradshaw).
