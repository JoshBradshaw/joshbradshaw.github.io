## The Hospital for Sick Children

During university I did two co-op terms at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) under the supervision of [Dr. Chris Macgowan](http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Directory/People/M/christopher-macgowan-staff-profile.html). While I was working there, Dr. Macgowan primarily focused on fetal cardiac imaging using MRI.

- **[PressureTrigger: an MRI cardiac triggering system.](pressuretrigger)** One of the major challenges in cardiac MRI is synchronizing the relatively slow MRI aquisition with the patient's cardiac cycle. During my internship at the hospital for Sick Children, I was tasked with building a system that used surgically implanted blood pressure probes to trigger the MRI scanners in real time. This system was used extensively in animal research.

- **[Bloodtools: an image processing suite for real time fetal MRI analysis.](bloodtools)** I worked on commercializing a measurement protocol that allowed radiologists to non-invasively measure fetal blood oxygen saturation and hematocrit using a series of MRI images. Bloodtools was a software application that allowed clinical researchers to carry out the measurement protocol independently, without direct assistance from the scientists who developed the protocol.


## Academic Projects

Throughout my engineering degree I strived to create an elaborate final project for each course. My most interesting projects are listed here.

- **[Skeleprint - A 3D printer for bone graft prototyping](skeleprint)** was my award-winning fourth year design project at the University of Waterloo. We created Skeleprint as a novel approach to bone graft manufacturing. The printer was designed to work with a new biocompatible material developed by [Professor Thomas Willett's Biomaterial's lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/systems-design-engineering/people-profiles/thomas-willett). I worked on this project with team members Alex Upenieks, [Shubh Jagani](http://www.shubhjagani.com/), [Isaac Hunter](https://isaachunter.ca/), [Kyla Gardner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyla-gardner-4a267163/), and [Matt Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt--jones/). I was the team leader, and I did the majority of the hardware and firmware design for the printer itself.

- **[MRI Compatible Amplifier for Arterial Blood Pressure Probes](/pdfs/SYDE_362_IBP_Measurement_System_Final_Report.pdf)**. As my third year design project, I decided to build an extension upon the cardiac gating MRI triggering system that I built for the Hospital for Sick Children during my internship. In the original system, I used a high end blood pressure transducer from Samba sensors that cost $13,000, because the lab already had one in stock. After my internship, the Samba unit started to malfunction, so I decided to try building a simpler low cost alternative in the ($150-300) price range. I was successful, and this amplifier has been used in several published experiments, and won the third year systems design engineering symposium at the University of Waterloo.

- **[SMRT WATR: An Interative Water Fountain](smrtwatr)** was my third year design project. Our goal was to use internet of things (IOT) technology to provide entertainment encourage social interaction in public spaces. I worked on this project with [Emma Cooper](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmamcooper/), [Matt Jones](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt--jones/), [Isaac Hunter](https://isaachunter.ca/), [Adam Thompson](http://adamthompson.ca/), and Shubh Jagani. Based on this goal, we decided to create a mechanized water fountain which would react dynamically while users played an online quiz game. We managed to create a fully functional prototype that won the people's choice award at the design symposium.

- **[Neural Simulation of Lamprey Swimming](../pdfs/LampreySwimming.pdf)** this was my final project for [SYDE 556 - Simulating Neurobiological Systems](http://compneuro.uwaterloo.ca/courses/syde-750.html). As an extension of a [paper published by Dwight Kuo and Chris Eliasmith](http://arts.uwaterloo.ca/~celiasmi/Papers/kuo.eliasmith.2004.zebrafish%20swimming.neuroc.pdf) I derived a model for the spinal cord motion of the swimming lamprey and implemented it in python using the Neural Engineering Framework.


## Crowdlab at the University of Waterloo

- **[crowdEEG Annotation Interface.](http://crowdeeg.ca/)** I was the initial developer of crowdEEG, an online EEG annotaion interface that is used to crowdsource EEG annotation tasks. Crowdsourcing EEG annotation is desirable for building machine learning data sets, because it means that a large dataset can be assembled quickly and inexpensively.

## Electronic Art

- **[Infinity Mirror](infinitymirror).** I built a dynamic square infinity mirror as a Christmas present for my friend.
