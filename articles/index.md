Some of my favourite pieces of writing are those that take challenging subjects and illuminate them for a general audience. Some of my favourite works in the category are: 
- [Randall Munroe's XKCD - what if?](https://what-if.xkcd.com/)
- Bill Bryson's a Brief History of Nearly Everything
- Horowitz and Hill's The Art of Electronics 
- Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time. 

I read all of these books while I was in high school, and they're what inspired me to pursue science and engineering.

Communicating scientific ideas to people with a very minimal background is challenging. Its very easy to descend into jargon, or lean on crude analogies. However, I think that the ability to explain technical concepts clearly to people in other disciplines is an essential part of good engineering work.

Now that I've finished my engineering degree, I've decided that one way I will continue learning is by writing articles about complex technical subjects, intended for a non-technical audience. These articles will focus on subjects that I have recently worked on, or am hoping to explore further in the near future.
