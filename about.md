title: About Me
---


I'm a student at the University of Waterloo, currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Systems Design Engineering. I love learning, and hope to eventually work in research. My favorite courses are in the fields of physics and computer science. I like to delve deeply into topics, dividing and conquering each piece until I'm able to make useful extensions on the ideas.  

## Arts

I play the saxophone, and the clarinet. For several years I used busked in the Dundas town square in an effort to simultaniously overcome my shyness and finance my equipment.

## Adventure

I love to hike, mountain bike, climb and occasionally paddle. I'm passionate about nature, and I spend as much time outdoors as possible.
