Hello! I'm an aspiring medical device designer, currently studying systems design engineering at the University of Waterloo with a focus on electrical engineering for biomedical applications. 

## Selected Projects:

#### [Arterial Blood Pressure Triggering System](http://joshbradshaw.github.io/Arterial-BP-MRI-Triggering-Unit/)

I built this solo-project while working in Chris Macgowan's medical imaging lab at SickKids hospital. 

#### [WatSat: Cube Satellite Student Design Project](http://watsat.ca/)
