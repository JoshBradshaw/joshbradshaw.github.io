Over the last year, I've become enamored with the fringe sport of slackline. I began slacklining in earnest after meeting Gerald Situ at Woodbine beach in Toronto. Gerald was walking across an 80m longline floating in the air, well above head height. It was an inspiring scene, and by the end of the day Gerald taught me how to wobble my way across his shorter lines. Slackline became my obsession through the remainder of that sun-soaked summer in the city, and I got to know everyone in the local slackline community.

On my last weekend in the city, my friends took me highlining for the first time. We put the highline up in two trees on the Toronto waterfront I only managed to cross 1/3rd of the line, but it was an absolute blast. Here's a photo of one of my better efforts.

When I returned to uWaterloo, I needed to keep slacklining, so I decided to start a [community for slackliners in the KW area](https://www.facebook.com/groups/646764172125480/). I hold events every Friday, from 3pm to dusk, and everyone is welcome to come join us.
