Over the last year, I've become enamored with the fringe sport of slackline. I began slacklining in earnest after meeting Gerald Situ at Woodbine beach in Toronto. Gerald was walking an 80m longline, floating high in the air. It was an inspiring scene, and by the end of the day Gerald taught me how to wobble my way across his shorter lines. Slackline became my obsession during that sun-soaked summer in the city, and I got to know everyone in the local slackline community.

On my last weekend in the city, my friends took me highlining for the first time. We put the highline approximately three stories up, between two trees on the Toronto waterfront. It took us over four hours to get the line up, because we took great pains to ensure that the setup was as safe as possible. I only managed to cross 1/3rd of the line, but it was an absolute blast. Here's a photo of one of my better efforts:

When summer ended, and it came time for me to return to uWaterloo, I decided to start a [community for slackliners in the KW area](https://www.facebook.com/groups/646764172125480/). I hold events every Friday, from 3pm to dusk for all of the local slackliners. These events have been very successful so far, and I plan on keeping them going into the Fall.
