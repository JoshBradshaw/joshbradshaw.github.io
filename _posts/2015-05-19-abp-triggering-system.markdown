The Arterial Blood Pressure Triggering System was my primary project during my four month co-op term in Chris Macgowan's MRI lab at SickKids. Chris hired me because he needed instrumentation to synchronize MRI scans with the motion of fetal pig hearts, but the only solutions available cost >$20,000 and were not guaranteed to work.

#### Learning about the problem

To gain a better understanding of the unique challenges associated with MRI research, I volunteered as a test subject for 12 sessions, spending one hour in the scanner each time. Through these sessions, I got to experiment with a variety of instruments, have extended conversations with MRI technicians about safety concerns, and watch HD video of my heart beating.

Next, I began a broad search of the literature.
