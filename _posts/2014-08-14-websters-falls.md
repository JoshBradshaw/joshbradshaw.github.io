The Spencer gorge is the crown jewel of Dundas; my home town. I've hiked the area hundreds of times, yet it still has a profound aweing effect on me each and every time I visit. It's beautiful vistas are surpassed only by it's twin waterfalls: Webster's and Tew's falls. Despite being contained in a relatively small area, the Spencer gorge feels like a true wilderness. Especially in the major lower gorge that leads to the base of Webster's falls, the wraparound cliffs provide a natural barrier, providing seclusion and significantly cooler temperature than the surrounding area.

Unfortunately, the stairs by which most visitors access this beautiful place have recently been closed indefinitely. Thanks in part to initiatives like [Hamilton City of Waterfalls](http://cityofwaterfalls.ca/), the area has been recieving significantly more visits. In a public statement, the Hamilton Conservation Authority says:
> The stairway leading to the base of Webster's Falls is considered inadequate to safely handle the number of people that the area now attracts. The stairway, built many years ago, is used by visitors to gain access to both the bottom of the Spencer Gorge and the base of Webster's Falls.

Having visited the stairs from below, I confess relucantly that I agree with the Conservation Authority's judgement. The stairs have always been a little bit rough around the edges, but this past winter had a significant destructive effect. The stone steps are twisted almost beyond recognition, and the cement anchors for the steel staircases are beginning to crumble. Despite this, the lower gorge is still accessible, as I will explain in the remainder of this post. 

## Route from the bottom
With the connection between the top and the bottom severed, your best bet for accessing the lower gorge is to start at the bottom. The trail from below starts at the bottom of the highway 8 hill, and is completely unmarked.

I have indicated on this map in red the approximate start location (copyright Google).

One the road you'll be able to see the railway bridge which crosses over the road. You should be able to park on the soft shoulder there, but if all of the parking is taken you can park at one of the nearby parks or sidestreets surrounding King street.

Once you've arrived at the junction, proceed up the hill, following any of the many small pathways. Once at the top, look both ways and cross the rails. Be very careful here, because all of the tracks are active and trains come down the escarpment unbelievably quickly. Once you're accross the tracks proceed East (towards the rocky outcrop) until you hit the lower Spencer Gorge trail. Follow this trail and you'll soon arrive at the base Webster's falls. 

## Route from the top
For the more intrepid, it is still possible to descend the walls of the gorge to reach the bottom. As shows in this diagram (the start of the first arrow is where the old stairs are)

The basic gist is that you walk along the fenceline past where the stairs used to be. Then you carry on in that direction, skirting around the edges of the private properties onto the Bruce trail that runs along the ridgeline. You follow this trail for a few hundred metres until the wall of the gorge's grade changes from sheer cliff to steep hill, then head down. Do your best to follow an existing path here, because this is a very sensitive area.

In a future update I'll explain how to somewhat safely access the base of Tew's Falls.

Enjoy!
