title: How to Access the Lower Spencer Gorge
---

The Spencer gorge is the crown jewel of Dundas; my home town. I've hiked the area hundreds of times, yet it still has a profound aweing effect on me each and every time I visit. It's beautiful vistas are surpassed only by it's twin waterfalls: Webster's and Tew's falls. Despite being contained in a relatively small area, the Spencer gorge feels like a true wilderness. Especially in the major lower gorge that leads to the base of Webster's falls, the wraparound cliffs provide a natural barrier, providing seclusion and significantly cooler temperature than the surrounding area.

Unfortunately, the stairs by which most visitors access this beautiful place have recently been closed indefinitely. Thanks in part to initiatives like [Hamilton City of Waterfalls](http://cityofwaterfalls.ca/), the area has been recieving significantly more visits. In a public statement, the Hamilton Conservation Authority says:
> The stairway leading to the base of Webster's Falls is considered inadequate to safely handle the number of people that the area now attracts. The stairway, built many years ago, is used by visitors to gain access to both the bottom of the Spencer Gorge and the base of Webster's Falls.

Having visited the stairs from below, I confess relucantly that I agree with the Conservatoin Authority's judgement. The stairs have always been a little bit rough around the edges, but this past winter had a significant destructive effect. The stone steps are twisted almost beyond recognition, and the cement anchors for the steel staircases are beginning to crumble. Despite this, the lower gorge is still accessible, as I will explain in the remainder of this post.
