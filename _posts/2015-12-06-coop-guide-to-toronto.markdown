I've spent four great work terms in Toronto, and I frequently get asked for advice about where to live and where to go in the city. This post is my best effort at compiling all the different recommendations I've made. This post isn't exhaustive, and it reflects my personal preferences and budget. I hope that you will find it helpful for starting your own adventures on co-op. I hope that this list will encourage you to go out and try something new.

## Where to Live

I highly recommend living downtown. Downtown living is expensive, but that expense is justified, because you'll have so much more fun. Finding a good apartment downtown Toronto can be a frustrating experience. Toronto has three large universities, and students at those schools snatch up pretty much all of the decent student rentals. The exception is the spring term, when there are far fewer students. In the spring term you can live in University of Toronto or Ryerson residence, or sublet an apartment from students.

In Fall or Winter terms, you can expect to pay $600-$800/month for a compromise downtown apartment. A compromise apartment is one in which you compromise on location, space, privacy, or all of the above. A typical way to lower the cost of living is to cram more people into an apartment than there are bedrooms. This style of living does lead to some awkward situations, such as inviting your significant other to spend the night in your living room fort, but with good friends and a sense of humor this can be a great way to save serious cash. 

In Fall and Winter, affordable apartments are typically in the older buildings surrounding Ryerson, such as 250 Jarvis St., 40 Gerrard St E., and the building behind 250 Jarvis St. on Carleton. These buildings are comprised of two bedroom apartments, which you can cram three people into. There are similar living arrangements available in the small buildings surrounding Kensington. Especially around Kensington, the apartments can be sketchy, so be sure to check the UW [off campus safety checklist.](https://uwaterloo.ca/off-campus-housing/sites/ca.off-campus-housing/files/uploads/files/OCH_Checklist.pdf). Those with more money than me can rent at Tartu college, or the the apartments on lower Yonge street. UW students studying finance often sign full year leases on nice Toronto condos with financial assistance from their parents, then sublet them throughout the year. These places are pricey, but super nice. 

# Activities

Here's a list of outings that I particularly enjoyed. Every term there is a Facebook group created called UW Watpub Toronto, and that's a great place to post events and meet other UW students in the city. In addition to these lists, there are tons of festivals and events in Toronto every single day. Use facebook and meetup.com to stay in the loop.

## Evening Activities and Nightlife

1. Thursday Night at the Madison Avenue pub -- the Madison is a great University of Toronto hangout. It's divided into dozens of rooms, each of which presents a different aesthetic. The piano lounge is particularly fun.
2. Einsteins open mic night (usually Wednesday) -- this event is hit and miss. If you're a musician it can be a fun place to play to a receptive crowd.
3. Saturday night at the Horseshoe Tavern -- rock venue. The bands are consistently good.
4. Saturday night at the Reservoir lounge -- a cozy venue with kickass swing band. This place usually attracts an older crowd, but it's an awesome place to spend the evening once you get tired of the U of T watering holes.
5. Green Room / Red Room / Pour Boy -- these are all owned by the same family and work by the same formula. Cheap drinks, cheap food that's pretty decent, nice atmosphere, and hit and miss service. 6. Wednesday at the AGO -- free admission. Go with friends and visit a random cafe after.
7. Climbing at Joe Rockheads / Boulderz / True North -- I love climbing and on of my work terms I got a Joe Rockheads membership. It was a great way to spend the evenings in the winter, especially because is was my 1A co-op and very few of my friends lived downtown and I couldn't go to the 19+ co-op meetup events.
8. Snakes and Lattes / Snakes and Lagers -- take a group of 4+ for the best experience.
9. Hot Docs Cinema -- cool theater.
10. TIFF cinema -- see a classic movie and tour the building.
11. City Hall Observation Deck -- At least as good of a view as the CN tower. You can see to the far side of the Toronto Island looking south, and past the edge of the city looking North. The deck is enclosed only by grating, with no glass, so it's a photographer's paradise.
12. Events at MARS -- there are lots of different tech talks and groups that meet at MARS. This can be a great way to score a free lunch if you work in a nearby hospital ;).

## Weekend Activities

1. Pottery class at Gardiner museum -- cheap fun outing. ~$10 for the class + $5 to get your pieces fired. I built snoopy and he turned out great.
2. CN Tower -- I think that the CN tower is an overpriced and overrated outing, but if you've never been up there and you want to go, the best way to visit is to take a date up there for lunch in the Horizon's restaurant. This will be a much more memorable experience than the normal observation deck tour, and its only marginally expensive. 
3. Ripley's Aquarium -- buy your tickets in advance to get a discount. This place looks small from the outside, but the exhibits go on much longer than you would expect, and I highly recommend going
4. Skyzone Trampoline park -- this place is super fun, and super exhausting. Next door to Skyzone is the Amsterdam brewery, which offers free tours on weekends, and after the tour they'll usually treat you to unlimited free samples of their seasonal beers. This is an amazing way to spend a bad weather day with close friends.
5. Biking the Martin Goodman Trail -- ride from the west end to the beaches, its a great Sunday afternoon jaunt.
6. Visiting the Leslie street spit -- take a bike. This is a cool place to visit, but too boring to be worth hiking.
7. Cherry Beach -- yes you can swim in Lake Ontario, don't be a coward.
8. Slackline Toronto -- slacklining has developed a cult following in Toronto. I went to the events in Trinity-Bellwoods every single Sunday and made several close friends there. 
9. Royal Ontario Museum -- the ROM has free admission days for students, and you can also get free passes by signing up for a Toronto library membership.
10. Skating at Nathan Phillips Square / the Waterfront Rink -- super fun, cheap skate rentals available.
11. Urban exploration -- there's a very cool basement that runs underneath the hospitals on Gerrard St. connecting them all together through a labyrinth of tunnels.
12. Exploring Toronto's Neighborhoods -- you can walk to and explore Chinatown, Little Italy, the Annex, Kensington, the Fashion District, ect. Slightly further afield you have little Portugal, little Vietnam, Koreatown, Queen West, the Danforth ect. Spend an afternoon checking out each one.
13. Little Theatre on the Danforth -- super cute, super fun.
14. Open Doors TO -- not to be missed. Pick the buildings you want to tour in advance.
15. Tours of St. Andrew's Cathedral -- architectural masterpiece, go when the organist is playing.
16. Hiking along the Humber river on the west end -- go to Old Mill subway station, walk from there. It's quite beautiful in Winter.
17. High Park / Christie Pits Park / Trinity Bellwoods Park / Kew Gardens -- this is where I could be found slacklining almost single day of 2014. These parks are beautiful, and you'll meet very friendly locals if you hang out in them.
18. Scarborough Bluffs -- cool bike trip destination. The brave can bike down the near the edges of the bluffs on very steep trails (this may be illegal now). There's a marked network of suburban streets extending the Martin Goodman trail that you can use to bike here from downtown.
19. Harbor-front -- The parks and walkways make for a great picnic location. Got around sunset (or sunrise if you're a crazy person).
20. Concerts at the EX -- these happen at the end of spring term and the start of fall term, I mention them here because they're super affordable and the bands are usually great.
