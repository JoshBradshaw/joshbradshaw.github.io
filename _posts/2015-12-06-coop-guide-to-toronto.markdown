I spent four works terms in Toronto, and I had great adventures there. Toronto is a really wonderful city, with limitless affordable entertainment. One of my favorite days ever on co-op was an afternoon in which I met five new friends, explored the Island, watched a world cup game in Little Italy, then spontaneously threw a rooftop party. When living the UW grind, your free time is precious, and I hope that this post will give you inspiration for your own great adventures in the city.

## Where to Live

I recommend living downtown. Downtown living is expensive, but that expense is justified by how much fun you'll have. Finding a good apartment downtown can be a frustrating experience, because the local students will have already snatched up every affordable place by the time you start looking. Spring term is the exception. In spring term you can live in University of Toronto or Ryerson residence, or sublet a nice place.

In Fall or Winter terms, you can expect to pay $500-$800/month for a compromise downtown apartment. A compromise apartment is one in which you compromise on location, space, privacy, or all of the above. A typical way to lower the cost of living is to cram more people into an apartment than there are bedrooms. This style of living does lead to some awkward situations, such as inviting your significant other to spend the night in a living room fort, but with good friends and a sense of humor this can be a fun lifestyle.

In Fall and Winter, affordable apartments are typically found in the older buildings surrounding Ryerson, such as 250 Jarvis St., 40 Gerrard St E., and the building behind 250 Jarvis St. on Carleton St. These buildings are comprised of two bedroom apartments, which you can cram 3+ people into as required by your budget. There are similar living arrangements available in the small buildings surrounding Kensington. The apartments can be sketchy, so be sure to check the UW [off campus safety checklist.](https://uwaterloo.ca/off-campus-housing/sites/ca.off-campus-housing/files/uploads/files/OCH_Checklist.pdf). Those with more money than me can rent at Tartu college, or the apartments on lower Yonge street. UW students studying finance often sign full year leases on nice Toronto condos with financial assistance from their parents, then sublet them throughout the year. Those places are expensive and very nice.

# Activities

Here's a list of outings that I particularly enjoyed. Every term there is a Facebook group created called UW Watpub Toronto, and that's a great place to post events and meet other UW students in the city. In addition to these lists, there are tons of festivals and events in Toronto every single day. Use facebook and meetup.com to stay in the loop.

Instead of given specific addresses in this list, I mostly just give neighborhood names. [This map of Toronto's neighborhoods is super useful for exploring.](http://www.blogto.com/neighbourhoods/) Most of these things are close enough to downtown that you can just walk there. [BlogTO also publishes guides to each neighborhood.](http://www.blogto.com/torontomaps/)

## Evening Activities and Nightlife

1. Thursday Night at the Madison Avenue pub -- the Madison is a great University of Toronto hangout, and a typical UW co-op student meetup location. It's divided into dozens of rooms, each of which presents a different aesthetic. The piano lounge is particularly fun. $3.50 drinks.
2. Einsteins open mic night (usually Wednesday) -- this event is hit and miss. If you're a musician it can be a fun place to play to a receptive crowd. $10 pitchers.
3. Saturday night at the Horseshoe Tavern -- rock venue. The bands are consistently good. $10+ cover and $5+ drinks.
4. Saturday night at the Reservoir lounge -- a cozy venue with kickass swing band. This place usually attracts an older crowd, but it's an awesome place to spend the evening once you get tired of the U of T watering holes. Also a good date location (reserve a table in advance and go early). $5 cover, $8 drinks. Located on the East edge of the financial district.
5. Green Room / Red Room / Pour Boy -- these are all owned by the same family and work by the same formula. Cheap drinks, cheap food that's pretty decent, nice atmosphere, and hit and miss service.
6. Wednesday at the AGO -- free admission. Go with friends and visit a random cafe after. $3 drinks, $6 meals. Located on the West edge of the U of T neighborhood.
7. Climbing at Joe Rockheads / Boulderz / True North -- I love climbing and on of my work terms I got a Joe Rockheads membership. It was a great way to spend the evenings in the winter, especially because it was my 1A co-op and only a couple of my friends lived downtown. ~$40/month. Joe Rockheads is in Liberty Village, Boulderz and True North are at the distant edges of the city. 
8. Snakes and Lattes / Snakes and Lagers -- take a group of 4+ for the best experience.
9. Hot Docs Cinema -- cool theater. Located in the Annex neighborhood.
10. TIFF cinema -- see a classic movie and tour the building. Located in the Annex neighborhood.
11. City Hall Observation Deck -- Amazing view. You can see to the far side of the Toronto Island looking south, and past the edge of the city looking North. The deck is enclosed only by metal bars, with no glass, so it's a photographer's paradise. FREE.
12. Events at MARS -- there are lots of different tech talks and groups that meet at MARS. This can be a great way to score a free lunch if you work in a nearby hospital ;). Located at the southern edge of University of Toronto, on Hospital row.
13. Axe Throwing -- this is awesome, but expensive. If your company has a co-op committee or a social events committee try to get them to pay for this event.
14. The Ram in the Rye -- this is Ryerson's bomber. I performed at open-mic night and had a pretty good time. Located on the Ryerson campus.

## Weekend Activities

1. Pottery class at the Gardiner museum -- cheap fun outing. ~$10 for the class + $5 to get your pieces fired. I built snoopy and he turned out great. Located in the middle of U of T.
2. CN Tower -- I think that the CN tower is an overpriced and overrated outing, but if you've never been up there and you want to go, the best way to visit is to take a date up there for lunch in the Horizons restaurant. This will be a much more memorable experience than the normal observation deck tour, and its only marginally more expensive. 
3. Ripley's Aquarium -- buy your tickets in advance to get a discount. This place looks small from the outside, but the exhibits go on much longer than you would expect, and I highly recommend going
4. Skyzone Trampoline park -- this place is fun, but exhausting. Next door to Skyzone is the Amsterdam brewery, which offers free tours on weekends, and after the tour they'll usually treat you to unlimited free samples of their seasonal beers. This is an amazing way to spend a bad weather day with close friends. Located on the North East corner of the city, I recommend splitting an Uber there, because the bus route sucks.
5. Biking the Martin Goodman Trail -- ride from the west end to the beaches, its a great Sunday afternoon jaunt.
6. Visiting the Leslie street spit -- take a bike. This is a cool place to visit, but too boring to be worth hiking.
7. Cherry Beach -- yes you can swim in Lake Ontario, don't be a coward.
8. Slackline Toronto -- slacklining has developed a cult following in Toronto. I went to the events in Trinity-Bellwoods every single Sunday and made several close friends there. 
9. Royal Ontario Museum -- the ROM has free admission days for students, and you can also get [free passes to ~10 museums from the Toronto Library.](http://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/museum-arts-passes/)
10. Skating at Nathan Phillips Square / the Waterfront Rink -- cheap skate rentals available.
11. Urban exploration -- there's a very cool basement that runs underneath the hospitals on Gerrard St. connecting them all together through a labyrinth of tunnels.
12. Exploring Toronto's Neighborhoods -- you can walk to and explore Chinatown, Little Italy, the Annex, Kensington, the Fashion District, ect. Slightly further afield you have little Portugal, little Vietnam, Koreatown, Queen West, the Danforth ect. Spend an afternoon checking out each one.
13. Little Theatre on the Danforth -- nice outing or date.
14. Open Doors TO -- not to be missed. Pick the buildings you want to tour in advance.
15. Tours of St. Andrew's Cathedral -- architectural masterpiece, go when the organist is playing.
16. Hiking along the Humber river on the west end -- go to Old Mill subway station, walk from there. It's quite beautiful in Winter.
17. High Park / Christie Pits Park / Trinity Bellwoods Park / Kew Gardens -- this is where I could be found slacklining almost single day in 2014. These parks are beautiful, and you'll meet very friendly locals if you hang out in them.
18. Scarborough Bluffs -- cool bike trip destination. The brave can bike down the near the edges of the bluffs on very steep trails (this may be illegal now). There's a marked network of suburban streets extending the Martin Goodman trail that you can use to bike here from downtown.
19. Harbor-front -- The parks and walkways make for a great picnic location. Watch the sunset there.
20. Concerts at the EX -- these happen at the end of spring term and the start of fall term, I mention them here because they're affordable and the bands are usually great.
21. Sailing in Ashbridges Bay -- admittedly I haven't actually done this yet, but it looks fun when I bike by.
22. Exploring the Distillery District -- bring your camera. Pop into the galleries, the chocolate factory and try the special seasonal beers at Mill St that they only serve in their pub.
23. Go to the top floor of the banks at Bay/King -- The view from the tops of these buildings is comparable to the CN tower view. Ask your finance friends to take you.
24. Winterlicious / Summerlicious -- affordable fancy restaurant date. Yelp is your friend.
25. Toronto Island -- classic day tripnb
