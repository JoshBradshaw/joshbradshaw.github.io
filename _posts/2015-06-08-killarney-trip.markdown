I spent the weekend of June 5-7th canoing in Killarney with the UW Outer's club. We did the Bell-David-Balsam-Three Mile-Bell loop, with 22km padding and 1.6km portaging, which made for a relaxed pace. The scenery was spectacular and being early season, we had the park to ourselves.  

On Saturday we did a day long hike, up and across a steep ridge-line to the highest point in the park. It was a clear day, so we were able to see all the way to Sudbury and Georgian Bay, which were ~100km away.

I was slightly nervous before this trip about the prospect of going into the back country with a group of strangers, but it ended up being a great experience. Spending three days in the wilderness without the distractions of technology made it easy to connect, and I'm already planning more adventures with friends I made along the way.
